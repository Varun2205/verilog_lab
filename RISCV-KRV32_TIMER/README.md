The timer is implemented as Synchronous, clock-driven sequential logic. Which means:
- `mtime` increments on `posedge clk`
- `mtimecmp` stored in registers
- Interrupt generated by combinational comparator
- Also splits the 64 bit register over a 32bit bus

Memory map table
(Why do this? Since it is a 32bit RISC V core and we are usign a 64bit register)

| Address Offset | Register Acess  |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| addr[3:2]=00   | mtime[31:0]     |
| addr[3:2]=01   | mtime[63:32]    |
| addr[3:2]=10   | mtimecmp[31:0]  |
| addr[3:2]=11   | mtimecmp[63:32] |
Essentially we are splitting a 64 bit register into 2 and then again into 4.

 To do:
- Add a CPU interrupt

NOTE:
- `mtimecmp` — Machine Time Compare Register
- `mtime` — Machine Time Register. It increments every CLK cycle
