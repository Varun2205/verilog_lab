The timer is implemented as Synchronous, clock-driven sequential logic. Which means:
- `mtime` increments on `posedge clk`
- `mtimecmp` stored in registers
- Interrupt generated by combinational comparator
- Also splits the 64 bit register over a 32bit bus

 To do:
- Add a CPU interrupt

NOTE:
- `mtimecmp` — Machine Time Compare Register
- `mtime` — Machine Time Register
